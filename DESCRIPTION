Description:
    Vector autoregressive (VAR) model is a fundamental and effective approach
    for multivariate time series analysis. Shrinkage estimation methods can be
    applied to high-dimensional VAR models with dimensionality greater than
    the number of observations, contrary to the standard ordinary least squares
    method. The package VARshrink is an integrative R package delivering
    nonparametric, parametric, and semiparametric methods in a unified and
    consistent manner, such as the multivariate ridge regression, a James-Stein
    type nonparametric shrinkage method, and Bayesian estimation methods using
    noninformative and informative priors.
